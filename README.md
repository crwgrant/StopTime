# StopTime
This is my GitHub page for StopTime, a very basic timer program I made with Visual Studio and Visual Basic.

## Why is it basic?
* Simple start/stop fucntionality
* Nothing else in it
..* I'm a new programmer so I don't know how to put harmful stuff in it.
* And it's free. Because I wouldn't pay for it either. 

## Here's what it looks like
* StopWatch Tab

* Timer Tab

Thanks for stopping by and looking.
